# CS50x-Final-Project
##This is my CS50

* Fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 100   
* Skip 2 cells if next number is in horizontal or vertical place
* Skip 1 cell if next number is in diagonals
* Two modes available    
  * Solitaire
  * Player Vs. CPU
* Player always begins the game
> In Vs. CPU, chould be a simple random choice, so it does not make sense to have CPU starting first
* A couple of features are hidden (almost) in the code

Have fun.
