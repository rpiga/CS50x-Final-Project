# CS50x-Final-Project
##This is my CS50

* Fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 100.
* Two simple rules to follow:
 * Skip 2 cells if you want to place next number horizontally or vertically.
 * Skip 1 cell if you want to place next number diagonally.
* Two modes available
  * Solitaire
  * Player Vs. CPU
* Player always begins the game by selecting any of the 100 cells

> In Vs. CPU mode, it should be a simple random choice, so it actually does not make sense to have CPU starting first

* A couple of additional features are hidden (almost) in the code.
* This was actually an old pen & paper game I'm used to play. I'm not able to find its original name, so I simply called this "**Road to 100**"

Have fun.
